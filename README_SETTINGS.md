# Settings Configuration

## Important: Local Settings File

The `settings.toml` file contains sensitive credentials and API keys. This file is now in `.gitignore` and will **not** be committed to the repository.

## Setup

1. Copy `settings.toml.template` to `settings.toml`
2. Fill in your actual credentials:
   - WiFi password
   - Accuweather API keys
   - Adafruit IO key

## Security Note

Never commit actual credentials to the repository. Always use the template file as reference.

## Current Configuration

Your local `settings.toml` still contains your actual credentials and will continue to work as before.
